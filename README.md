## Image Converter (JPG To PNG Or Vice Versa)

This IMAGE CONVERTER PROGRAM allows us to convert images of one type to another.

- This Simple Image Converter is built using Python and Tkinter module. It can convert JPG images to PNG or vice versa.

- I gave it a simple GUI look using the Tkinter module. It contains a simple interface with some buttons and images on it.

- ***NOTE***: All images used by me in this program are of their respective owners. I do not own any of them.


## Installation

To use this program on your computer, you need to have python installed on your system. We are using the Tkinter module for GUI purpose and this module is the pre-installed module, it comes with Python IDLE or interpreter. 

We also used the ***Pillow*** module in this program to handle images. Specifically, I used the Image class of **Pillow** module to open and save images.

You can install the ***Pillow*** module in your system by executing below command in terminal or PowerShell.

```bash
pip install pip
```

## Pre-Requisites

There isn't any requirement to use this program, even a noob developer or even a non-programmer can easily use it.

Below I'm mentioning some of the modules which you need to import or you should have in your system.

```python
from tkinter import *
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
from tkinter import filedialog as fd

''' You need to import tkinter module, Pillow module and 
filedialog class of tkinter module for proper functioning 
of the program.'''
```

So, just download it and use it.
